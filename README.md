ðŸš¨**WARNING**ðŸš¨

This is uber alpha software; very much still a work in progress. It works for my purposes but is very likely going to change dramatically before I suggest anyone else use it. Consider this an unstable project for now. I believe there are benefits to working in public, which is why the project is public here on github while I'm still working on it.

At the moment it only runs from a Clojure REPL and doesn't do much. I'm planning on making a CLI and all kinds of other things, but this is just a side project which I work on very sporadically.

## Overview

Morphy is a static website generator written in Clojure. It was born of my frustration trying to configure other static website generators. I prefer writing software over configuring software, so I made morphy for myself so I could have a blog. Right now all it does is convert Markdown files to HTML, and insert that content into templates, to finally generate a whole website.

I already know HTML and CSS, and I believe that is all one should have to know to build a simple static website, because that's all websites are made of. Turns out you need to learn a little bit about templating as well to make a website in any sort of practical way, but my goal is to allow the simplest possible structure for the source files of static websites generated by morphy. I found the existing static site generators incredibly frustrating to configure and completely failed to use some of them to make my really basic website, so I gave up and made my own.

## Goals

My ultimate goal with Morphy is to make it as simple as possible to generate a valid website from source files. These are some more specific goals of the project that reflect that:

- Support templating files, so content files can be minimalist and never repeat boilerplate 
- Support arbitrary source file structure -- no imposed directory structure for content
- Make site content available in templates in an intuitive way that mirrors the directory structure on the filesystem
- Have opinionated defaults to minimize the amount of metadata users have to specify. For simple websites there should be no configuration at all.
- Avoid specifying any config for site generation in separate config files as much as possible.
  - Favour inferring rules for site generation from file names, source directory structure, file extensions, etc. and when necessary favour adding metadata to individual pages in context, not in a separate location.
- Provide a simple UI for minimally technical people that can be installed as a stand-alone utility, not requiring a whole Clojure development environment.

## Non-Goals

- Comprehensive tooling for all kinds of extra file types (i.e. image processing, scss/sass, JavaScript dialects or frameworks)
- Drag and drop layouts or WSIWYG content editing.
  - CSS is [powerful enough](http://www.csszengarden.com) to create any kind of layout. I have no ambitions of building a Wix-style editor for rearranging layouts without writing CSS.
  - Whilst I don't think anyone should have to learn a whole new language or JavaScript framework to build a website, I think it's reasonable to work in HTML and CSS.
- Ultimate flexibility. There are well established patterns and best practices for building websites, which I want to encourage people to follow by making those the simplest way to use morphy.

## Concept

Right now Morphy supports content written in Markdown (with front matter) and templates written in Mustache. Think of Morphy as a pipeline and your content as data that flows through it. Markdown and Mustache files go in, complete HTML documents come out. This is what [the pipeline](https://github.com/kiramclean/morphy/blob/main/src/morphy/core.clj#L39-L43) does at the moment:

Starting with source files

-> load each page and parse the front matter, extracting a title, description, and slug (which are inferred from the content if none are specified in the front matter)

-> process the content of each page from Markdown to HTML

-> render each page that itself uses site data

-> insert each page into a layout

-> write these pages to the filesystem again as the final website

### File Processing

**Which source files get processed into a web page?**

- Any files _not_ in a directory called `assets` get processed by the pipeline.
- Any files that _are in a directory called `assets`_ get ignored and pass through unchanged, copied to a directory in the built website that mirrors their location in the source directory
- Any files that _are not named `index.html` or `index.md`_ get expanded into a directory of their own with an `index.html` file inside. E.g. a file called `posts/my-first-blog-post.md` will be `posts/my-first-blog-post/index.html` in the built website. This is purely a vanity thing, so urls in the final website don't all need to have `.html` appended to them to work. Note this means you should have a `rel="canonical"` link in the website head for each page.
- Directory structure is arbitrary and preserved in the built website. Slugs are assumed from the location of files in the source directory.
  - slugs are also over-writable in front-matter

**How Morphy decides which transformations are applied to which files**

- As mentioned above any file in any directory called `assets` is not processed and gets copied as-is to a mirrored directory in the output location
- Otherwise it's based on file extensions
  - Any file with the `.md` extension gets its content processed from Markdown to HTML
  - Any file with the `.mustache` extension gets processed by the template renderer 
- All files get inserted into the layout as the final step
  - This is possible to override by specifying `site/no-layout: true` in the front-matter for a given page. This is useful for e.g. a 404 page or RSS feed template that you do not want inserted into the main default layout.
  
**Naming and placement conventions**

Morphy looks in specific places for layout files.
- Morphy looks for a file specifically called `_layout.mustache` for the layout (the "wrapper" for each page's content) 
  - If none is found it just outputs the page content on its own (assuming no wrapper)
- Morphy will use the closest layout found for each page, so you can override layouts in a given directory. This is what I mean:
  ```
  â”œâ”€â”€ source
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _layout.mustache <----- Think of this one as "root layout"
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ root-page.md <--------- This root page will be wrapped with its sibling
  â”‚   â”‚                           `_layout.mustache` ("root layout")
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ nested
  â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _layout.mustache <--- Think of this one as "nested layout"
  â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ nested-page.md <----- This nested page will be wrapped with the `_layout.mustache`
                                    that's _in the same directory_, NOT the one that's in the 
                                    root directory ("nested layout")
  ```
- You can specify a different layout for a given page by adding a `layout: layout-name` key to the front matter. Morphy will look for these named layouts in a root directory called `_layouts`.
- Mustache supports template partials (fragments of templates you can share to minimize duplication). Morphy assumes these partials are in a directory called `_partials`, and they are available by name in every page.
  - The same overriding mechanism the layouts use applies to partials as well. I.e. you can have a `_partials` directory nested inside any other directory and morphy will use the _closest partial with a given name_. You can see an example of how I use this to show a different header on different pages on my blog [here](https://github.com/kiramclean/blog/tree/main/site).

## Usage

I'm postponing writing proper documentation until this project is more stable because I want to minimize the number of times I have to rewrite documentation. I'm still experimenting with the best ways to accomplish the goals of the project so things are still quite unstable. I believe in working in the open, though, so that's why this work in progress is here on Github.

I do currently use this to build [my personal website](https://github.com/kiramclean/blog), so in theory so could you. This is how I currently do it:

- load `morphy.core` and switch to that namespace in a clojure REPL
- define these variables in the REPL:
  ```clojure
  (def input-dir "/Users/kira/code/projects/blog/site")
  (def output-dir "/Users/kira/code/projects/blog/dist")
  (def context {:input-dir input-dir
                :output-dir output-dir
                :root-url "https://kiramclean.com"
                :groups/sort-priority ["Recent"]})
  ```
- run `(generate-site context)`
- to see the website before deploying it, I switch into the `dist` directory and serve its contents with this alias I have defined in my shell profile:
  ```bash
  servedir='ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8000'
  ```

I'm more focused on settling the core of the generator now than building an adequate UX, but I plan on wrapping this in a stand-alone CLI with a built-in development server.

## Development

I try to keep my plans for this project organized in [this GitHub project](https://github.com/users/kiramclean/projects/2). It's not always exactly up to date, but should give a pretty good idea of where things are at.

The issues are intermingled with issues from my personal website, because both of these things compete for my free time, so I just keep one list.
