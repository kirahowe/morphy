title: Learning How to Code

Around this time last summer I started learning how to code. I had a wordpress
website and wanted to customize it, then I got sucked into a rabbit hole and
haven’t really surfaced since. I realized I would only be able to make it so far
coding in a box on a website with tutorials, as great as they are, and in the
fall I decided to go all in. Now I’m starting my second gig as a “real” web
developer and learning as fast as I can. As I go I’m learning as much about
learning how to code as I am about coding itself. Here are a few of the most
useful things I’ve learned so far and some tips if you want to get started
learning how to code.

## Just start

If you want to learn how to code, just get started. Don’t spend a lot of time
searching everywhere for the “best” resources. There are some that are better
than others, but whatever is most popular whenever you’re reading this is going
to be good enough to introduce you to programming and get you to a place where
you can choose a path for yourself. Just pick whatever is popular and get
started, then go from there. I wasted WAY too much time searching through every
possible boot camp and tutorial guide on the internet instead of just going
ahead and actually learning. The only way to learn how to code is to do it, so
any hands on tutorial you can find is good enough to get you started. If you
really don’t know where to start, learn command line and git

If you’ve looked through the options and still feel totally overwhelmed by the
sheer number of possible languages and paths to becoming a programmer, start
with learning your way around the command line and git. These are things that
you will need no matter what language you end up using and they will help you
develop good habits and a smooth workflow from day one. Don’t get overwhelmed
and think you have to learn everything. Just get used to navigating directories
from you command line instead of “finder” or “file explorer”, and start keeping
track of your projects using git. If you don’t have a whole project on the go
then make a repo for little coding exercises.

## Don’t get distracted

I get distracted really easily. If you’re one of those people who can set a task
and just sit down and do it from start to finish, then lucky you. I am not. I’m
one of those people with about a million “productivity” tools on the go, and
whenever someone tells me about the greatest new one, I end up spending an hour
exploring it instead of just using it to get to work. Having a personality like
mine is dangerous if you want to learn web development or computer programming
in general, because there are a virtually unlimited number of rabbit holes. And
that’s what they are. If you get sucked into some new language or framework or
workflow, you may never get out, or emerge at the end of a full week wondering
what just happened (if you’re at all like me).

It is so easy for me to spend hours learning something only tangentially related
to the main thing I’m working on. This is great because it means you learn a
little bit of everything, but obviously the downside is that projects take five
times longer to finish. If you have similar issues then I recommend setting very
strict goals for yourself. Be realistic about what you can achieve in a given
amount of time, and then set out to do exactly that — no more and no less. Then,
set aside a block of time just for exploring. Every time you come across a cool
new thing you want to try but don’t immediately need to learn to finish what
you’re working on, set it aside and promise yourself you’ll come back to it
during your “free” time.

## Keep going!

Anyway, this sort of sums up my learning experience so far. Basically my advice
boils down to “get to work”. Don’t make excuses about why you can’t start or
keep going. Just focus and work. And focus on moving forward, not sideways.
There’s a lot of value in being really good at something, as opposed to sort of
ok at lots of things. If you really want to learn how to code, it is worth it.
My short term projects for the time being are to make my own game with
javascript and to try out websockets, maybe with Rails. So far so good, but I
will post more updates here as I go. Good luck with your own journey!
