This is a book by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas about programming, but not in any
particular language. It’s about all the other things that go along with
programming, beyond just writing code. It’s a perfect book for beginners or
people who don’t have a lot of experience working on a huge code base. You can
learn pretty quickly how to write code that works, but writing code that is easy
to read and maintain is whole other process. This book is a great place to start
if you’re writing code that runs but is still sort of a mess. I feel like a lot
of the advice would be common sense to someone with 5+ years of programming
experience, but for beginners with a basic understanding of software development
and coding this book is a perfect place to start learning how to think about the
big picture.

## It’s a Great Time to be a Developer

One thing I kept thinking as I read this book was how much new developers take
for granted. Learning web development starting with Rails 4.x is a treat. Things
like modular code, composition as a design pattern, and the MVC framework are a
given. For developers who learn Rails first, this is just how things are. These
patterns seem to be getting more popular, but I got the sense from the book that
back when it was written (1999), this was not at all the case. This book gave me
a glimpse into the world of software development before those things were
standard practices and really makes me realize just how much groundwork has been
done already.

There were also two huge sections and countless references to the importance of
testing. This is something I also find relatively common among other Rails
developers. Of course there are lots of untested Rails apps out there, but
almost all of the medium to large sized Rails projects I’ve seen have pretty
good test coverage, often up to 100%.

## Don’t Try to Predict the Future

A message that always comes up in books like these is don’t try to predict the
future. I guess a lot of software developers have wasted a lot of time and money
building software that nobody uses. The authors of this book use analogies to
explain why you shouldn’t just guess what your app should be like. The one I
like the most is their comparison of developing new features to using tracer
bullets.

They liken building software to aiming at a target. When you first set out to
accomplish your mission you have an idea of what your target is; what it should
look like. The thing is, you probably don’t know where exactly that target is.
In combat, soldiers use tracer bullets that light up when they’re fired along
with their regular ammunition so they can see what is going on close to the
target. The authors recommend using “tracer-bullets” in your code: try something
that solves your problem quickly, visibly, and repeatably, but leaves a trail.
“Tracer bullets” also provide instant feedback. They don’t always hit the
intended target, but they at least make it clear what target you are hitting.
Rather than trying to predict the future and guessing what your app should do —
which would be like guessing where the target is and using up all of your
ammunition on that guess — waste a little bit of effort and money using “tracer
bullets” to prevent wasting a ton of effort and money hitting the wrong target.
I thought this was an interesting way to think about problem solving.

## Invest In Yourself, Trust Your Users, and Be a Little Paranoid

These are some other key messages of the book. In the early chapters the authors
talk about how programming is a continuous learning experience. If you want to
be a good developer you have to adapt to the never-ending stream of new
technologies, and think of education as an investment, not an expense. This is
what I love the most about programming — there’s an unlimited amount of stuff to
learn. Get used to reading programming books, taking courses, and attending
conferences in your spare time. That’s the life of a software developer.

Another crucial lesson important enough to have been included in this book is
learning to listen and respond to your users. This will make or break your
product or business. This section was very much related to the previous chapter
about not predicting the future. It can be hard to know when to stop tweaking
your code and adding or changing functionality, and these authors suggest making
your users the final authority on design decisions. The authors are big
advocates of user feedback and recommend writing code that above everything else
is end-user-friendly.

The last piece of advice that stuck with me is to be a little paranoid when you
code. By this the authors mean you should think through every design decision
you make before implementation, and patch your code as frequently as possible to
introduce only small changes at a time. A key takeaway from this is book is to
design for change and keep your code as flexible as possible to be able to
accomodate an unknown future.

## Do These and Many Other Things to Become a Pragmatic Programmer

There are of course tons of other stories and pieces of advice in the book. It’s
well worth a read, especially if you’re pretty early in your programming career.
The authors put programming principles in simple terms and use great analogies
to make the concepts sink in. They do a great job of explaining in a lot of
different ways why you should design for change, as opposed to pre-made
decisions, and write code that is flexible and open-ended. Following their
advice should set you on a path toward writing easier to read, more maintainable
code.
