title: Why Is Web Development So Complicated Now?

I first got into programming because I wanted to make my own websites. Back then
all it took was two files, an `index.html` and a style sheet. I recently decided
I wanted to start blogging again and started looking around for a simple static
site generator. There are a couple of reasons why I avoided some other
approaches.

- I have had negative experiences with Wordpress that make me not want to use it
    again. Plus it is way more sophisticated than I need for a simple place to
    publish some thoughts.
- I want unambiguous ownership of my blog. Less important but also relevant, I
  want to easily be able to control how it looks. This rules out quite a few
  popular batteries-included blogging platforms.
- I do not want to setup (and pay for) a server somewhere to serve a simple
    website with only static pages.

I've been writing software for the internet for some years now, but it's been a
while since I worked on anything like what we think of as a normal website. When
I started looking into how this is done these days I was surprised to find
mostly complicated, bloated frameworks that nearly completely abstract away the
basic task of generating HTML.

It doesn't take multiple new languages, frameworks, or build tools to make a
really simple website.

## Content is not software

Frameworks are for people building sophisticated software that happens to run in
a browser. There is no need for them if all you want to do is put some content
on the internet. I will argue that if your main goal is publishing content you
don't even need JavaScript at all.

JavaScript frameworks mostly help by allowing us to write non-trivial software
in a language less terrible than JavaScript itself. They can also help with
things like managing state, reacting to user input, and communicating
asynchronously with a server to get new information onto a page without
needing to refresh the whole thing. None of these challenges are relevant
when the main purpose of a website is to display static information.

For that, all we should need is a language to markup our plain words into
something a browser can render, like HTML.

## So what did I choose?

I prefer writing software over configuring software, and I resent things that
are more complicated than they need to be. I'm a minimalist by nature and I am
against the direction our industry is currently headed -- shipping bloated and
buggy software by the ton -- but that's a story for another day.

After some investigation and frustration trying to do simple things, like edit
canned templates or change the source and structure of my content, I of course
decided to write my own static site generator, like any sane developer would do.

For now all it does is convert my posts (which I write in markdown) into HTML
and put those HTML files in the right place. As my blog grows I'll add more
features, but for now that's all I need to do.

## A plea for simplicity

I get that a lot of people are not making really simple websites anymore. There
is some seriously sophisticated software running in browsers now, which I get
is the reason for the proliferation of JavaScript frameworks and build tools we
have now.

But a lot of people are still simply publishing content to the internet, and we
seem to have forgotten what a website is really made of. It's just HTML (which
is supposed to semantically mark up content to describe its _meaning and
structure_), and optional styling with CSS (to describe it's _appearance_).
These languages are not so complicated to write that we need complex frameworks
that add a dozen more layers between the content and the final static pages. If
all you want is to put some information on the internet, see if an old fashioned
HTML file might be all you need.
